                    Nowadays, technology allows us to communicate science globally, but it is often not approachable to
                    people with no scientific background. That is why we chose the challenge “STEM to STEAM”. We think
                    that art is an excellent tool of science communication, so we decided on an animation video, since
                    it is engaging to the viewer, and can be uploaded to platforms like YouTube and TikTok, making it
                    accessible to anyone with an electronic device and access to Wi-Fi. We also created a website with
                    links to further information. The mission we chose is the Artemis Program, as we wanted to
                    communicate its less known scientific aspect, besides the main goal.

                <h2 class="text-silver">Detailed project description</h2>
                <p>
                    Our project has the purpose of educating the general public about important space missions by NASA,
                    as well as about inspiring women in the space industry, such as the Artemis Program, using a
                    creative, artistic medium, like our video animation. To create the animation, we used the
                    “Procreate” program for the drawings, and the “GarageBand” program to insert the voice-over. While
                    we now only have the animation video for the Artemis Program, we would like to create more
                    animations in the future, concerning other, equally exciting NASA missions, which will all be found
                    on our website. HTML, Visual Studio Code and Tailwind CSS were used during the making of the site,
                    which contains the animations, as well as further explanations, and links to the official NASA
                    website for more information. The site is deployed on GitHub Pages.
